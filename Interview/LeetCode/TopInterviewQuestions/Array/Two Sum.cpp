Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

        if(nums.size() < 2) return vector<int>();
        
        unordered_map<int, int> check;
        vector<int> result;
        for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++){
            if(check.find(nums[i]) != check.end()){
                result.emplace_back(check[nums[i]]);
                result.emplace_back(i);
