Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its depth = 3.

 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
